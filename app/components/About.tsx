				<h3>Education</h3>
				<p>
					I have a <span className="underline">BFA in Theatre</span> from the
					University of Utah, where I worked in acting, directing, writing, and
					project management. Iâ€™ve been in dozens of productions, acting as
					everything from a chorus member to the title character. For my senior
					project, I developed a VR app that integrated with an immersive theatre
					piece{' '}

				<h3>Any fun hobbies?</h3>
				<p>
					I love traveling, cooking (I was a sushi chef!), gaming in virtual reality,
					3D printing dungeons and dragons characters, building battle bots, playing
					saxophone, hiking, pickleball, and adding to this list.
				</p>
				<p>
					All of my hobbies are even better when I get to do them with my beautiful
					wife and daughter.
